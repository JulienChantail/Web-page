# Project README

## Overview

This project implements a web-based application using a Python backend to serve the pages, and SCSS for styling. The project also showcases the use of a `Makefile` to automate tasks such as dependency management, SCSS compilation, and running the server. The goal is to simplify the development workflow by automating common tasks.

### Project Requirements and Objectives

The project demonstrates the following:

- **Dependency Management**: Automating the installation of required dependencies.
- **Compilation**: Using `Makefile` to compile SCSS into CSS.
- **Project Version Management**: Managing project versions and ensuring that the right dependencies are installed.
- **Packaging**: Simulating packaging tasks through the use of build automation tools like `Makefile`.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project directory:

```
/project-directory
├── /assets

├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── compile_css.sh
├── login.html
├── makefile
├── requirements.txt
├── run_server.py
├── setup_dependencies.sh
```

- **/assets/stylesheets**: Directory where the compiled CSS file (`output.css`) is saved.
- **/mockups**: Contains the design mockups for the web pages.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.
- **compile_css.sh**: A script that compiles SCSS into CSS.
- **login.html**: The HTML file for the login page.
- **Makefile**: Defines automation tasks such as dependency installation, SCSS compilation, and server running.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains a list of Python dependencies.
- **run_server.py**: A Python script used to run the server and serve the HTML pages.
- **setup_dependencies.sh**: A script that installs the necessary system dependencies (Ruby, Python, Sass).

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install System Dependencies

You need to install several system dependencies for the project to work:

1. **Install Ruby, Python, and Pip**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y ruby-full python3 python3-pip
   ```

2. **Install Sass**:

   Sass is needed to compile SCSS to CSS.

   ```bash
   sudo gem install sass
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:

   Install the required Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

To simplify the process of setting up dependencies, you can run the `setup_dependencies.sh` script. This will install both the system and Python dependencies:

```bash
./setup_dependencies.sh
```

### Step 3: Start the Python Server

To serve the web pages locally, run the Python server:

```bash
python3 run_server.py
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:8000`, where you can view the pages:
- [About Musicca](http://localhost:8000/integration/about.html)
- [Login Page](http://localhost:8000/integration/login.html)

### Step 4: Compile SCSS to CSS

SCSS needs to be compiled into CSS for the website to display correctly. You can do this manually with the following command:

```bash
sass integration/style.scss integration/assets/stylesheets/output.css
```

Alternatively, you can automate this process by using the `compile_css.sh` script:

```bash
./compile_css.sh
```

The script will monitor changes to `style.scss` and recompile the CSS file automatically.

### Step 5: Clean Up

To remove the generated files (such as `output.css`), use the `clean` target from the `Makefile`:

```bash
make clean
```

## Makefile Breakdown

The `Makefile` automates common tasks related to this project, such as dependency installation, compiling SCSS, and running the server. Here's an overview of the key targets in the `Makefile`:

### Targets

#### `all`

This is the default target. Running `make` or `make all` will:

1. Install dependencies.
2. Compile SCSS to CSS.
3. Start the server.

```bash
make all
```

#### `dependencies`

Installs all required dependencies by running the `setup_dependencies.sh` script:

```bash
make dependencies
```

#### `css`

Compiles SCSS into CSS. This target uses the `sass` command to convert `style.scss` into `output.css`:

```bash
make css
```

#### `compile`

Runs the `compile_css.sh` script to compile SCSS into CSS. This script continuously watches for changes to the `style.scss` file and recompiles it:

```bash
make compile
```

#### `server`

Starts the Python HTTP server to serve the web pages:

```bash
make server
```

#### `clean`

Cleans up the generated files, such as `output.css`, by removing them:

```bash
make clean
```

## Git Version Management

This project uses Git for version control. Some important Git commands include:

### Commit Changes

After making changes to your code, commit them with a message describing the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
```

### Push to Remote Repository

Push the committed changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Create and Merge Branches

To work on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

After making changes, merge the branch back into the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

### Tagging Versions

Tag a specific version of your project with a Git tag:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## Running the Project

To run the project and access the web pages:

1. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   make server
   ```

2. **Access the pages**:

   Navigate to the following URLs in your browser:
   - `http://localhost:8000/integration/about.html`
   - `http://localhost:8000/integration/login.html`

3. **Clean up**:

   Remove generated files like `output.css` with:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## Conclusion

This project showcases a clean and efficient development workflow by automating common tasks such as dependency management, SCSS compilation, and server execution using `Makefile`. With Python as the backend, Sass for styling, and automation tools like `Makefile`, this project provides a solid foundation for web development and demonstrates best practices in modern web tooling.

By following the setup instructions and using the automation tools, you can quickly and easily get the project up and running.
